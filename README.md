# 🍝 API Project 2024  

**Final project – Algorithms and Data Structures**  
📍 *Politecnico di Milano*  
📊 **Grade: 30/30L**

---

## 🚀 Overview  
This project implements the management of **recipes, ingredients, and orders** using advanced data structures.  
The goal is to optimize **data access** and **priority handling** through the use of **hash tables**, **heaps**, and **linked lists**.

---

## 🧩 Data Structures Used  

- **Hash Table with Tombstones**  
  ↳ Used for managing **recipes**, handling collisions efficiently.  

- **Hash Table with Min-Heap**  
  ↳ Used for **ingredients**, ensuring that the one with the **earliest expiration date** is selected first.  

- **Linked List**  
  ↳ Manages the queue of **orders waiting** for unavailable ingredients.  

- **Max-Heap**  
  ↳ Used to order **pending orders** based on their **weight**, prioritizing the most important ones.

## 📂 Project Highlights  

- Custom implementation of fundamental data structures.  
- Focus on **efficient access** and **priority management**.  
- Integration of multiple hashing strategies and collision handling methods.
